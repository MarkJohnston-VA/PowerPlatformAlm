.SYNOPSIS
    Packs Power Platform Canvas Apps from source files back to .msapp format.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script searches for Canvas App source directories within a specified solution path and packs them
    back into .msapp files. This is the reverse operation of ExtractCanvasApps.ps1, allowing developers
    to convert their source-controlled Canvas App files back to the binary format required for deployment.
    
    The script uses the Power Platform CLI (pac) to pack Canvas App source files into .msapp files,
    making them ready for solution import and deployment to Power Platform environments.

.PARAMETER solutionPath
    The path to the solution directory containing Canvas App source directories to pack.
    This should be the root directory of your Power Platform solution.

.PARAMETER dryRun
    When set to $true (default), the script will only display what would be packed without actually
    performing the packing operation. Set to $false to perform the actual packing.

.EXAMPLE
    .\PackCanvasApps.ps1 -solutionPath "MarkTestSmall20250627" -dryRun $true
    
    Performs a dry run to show which Canvas App sources would be packed without actually packing them.

.EXAMPLE
    .\PackCanvasApps.ps1 -solutionPath "MarkTestSmall20250627" -dryRun $false
    
    Packs all Canvas App source directories found in the specified solution path to .msapp files.

.EXAMPLE
    .\PackCanvasApps.ps1 -solutionPath "C:\Solutions\MyPowerPlatformSolution"
    
    Performs a dry run (default behavior) for Canvas App sources in the specified absolute path.

    Prerequisites:
    - Power Platform CLI (pac) must be installed and available in the system PATH
    - Canvas App source directories must exist (typically created by ExtractCanvasApps.ps1)
    - Appropriate permissions to read source directories and write .msapp files
    
    The script looks for Canvas App source directories in the 'src/CanvasApps/src' path structure
    and creates corresponding .msapp files with '_DocumentUri.msapp' suffix.
