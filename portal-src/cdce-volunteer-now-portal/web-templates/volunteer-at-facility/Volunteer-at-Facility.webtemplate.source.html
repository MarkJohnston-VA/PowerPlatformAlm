                    <a name="learnmore"></a><strong>About Donations to VA</strong><br>
                    VA medical center directors have authority to accept gifts pursuant to 38 USC 8301 and VHA Handbook 4721 for the general benefit of the medical center and the Veterans we serve. The Chief, Center for Development and Civic Engagement (CDCE) at each VA medical center may accept gifts that benefit the facility and its patients except for gifts for research and education. Donations provide Veteran patients with many essential services and programs that otherwise would not be available to them, such as transportation services, social service assistance, rehabilitation equipment, recreation programs, activities, homeless Veteran's services, holiday gifts, phone cards and many other options. Your donations are 100 percent tax deductible and all administrative costs for VA are already appropriated by Congress, so you can be assured your entire donation is going directly to support Veterans in the way you choose.
